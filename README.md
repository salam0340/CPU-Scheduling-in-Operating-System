## 🚀 Implemented Algorithms

### 🧮 CPU Scheduling Algorithms

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS):** Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF):** Executes the process with the smallest execution time next.
- **Round Robin (RR):** Assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic order.
- **Priority Scheduling:** Processes are executed based on priority levels.

### 📦 Page Replacement Algorithms

- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO):** Replaces the oldest page in memory.
- **Optimal Page Replacement:** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.
